\begin{problem}
  Consider the 3-sphere as the set of unit quaternions
  \[ \{x+iy+jz+kw|x^2+y^2+z^2+w^2=1\} \]
  Let $\phi:U\rightarrow\bb{R}^3$ be $\phi(x+iy+jz+kw)=(y,z,w)\in\bb{R}^3$ where
  \[ U=\{x+iy+jz+kw\in S^3|x>0\} \]
  Consider $\phi$ as a chart. For each $q\in S^3$, define a chart $\psi_q$ by
  $\psi_q(p)=\phi(q^{-1}p)$. Show that this set of charts is an atlas for a
  smooth structure on $S^3$.
\end{problem}

First note that every point $q\in S^3\subset\bb{H}$ will be included
in the chart $\psi_q$. Moreover since $\psi_q$ will be a homeomorphism
if $\phi$ is a homeomorphism as $p\mapsto q^{-1}p$ is continuous where defined.
Thus all we need to show is that $\phi$ is 
a homeomorphism and that for $q,p\in S^3$ that $\psi_q\psi_p^{-1}$ is smooth.

The projection map $\phi$ is continuous. Define an inverse via
\[ \phi^{-1}(y,z,w)=\sqrt{1-y^2-z^2-w^2}+iy+jz+kw \]
This map is continuous as all of its components are continuous. Thus,
since $\phi$ has a continuous inverse, it is indeed a homeomorphism.
It then follows that $\psi_q$ is a homeomorphism due to the reasoning above.

Now we will show that for $q,p\in S^3$ that $\psi_q\psi_p^{-1}$ is smooth where
defined. Let $r=x+iy+jz+kw$ and $p=a+ib+jc+kd$.
Then we expand $\psi_q\psi_p^{-1}$ as
\begin{align*}
  \psi_q\psi_p^{-1}(r)&=\psi_q(p\phi^{-1}(r))\\
                &= \psi_q(p(\sqrt{1-y^2-z^2-w^2}+iy+jz+kw))\\
%                &= \psi_q((a\sqrt{1-y^2-z^2-w^2}-by-cz-dw)+(ay+\sqrt{1-y^2-z^2-w^2}b+cw-dz)i
%                  +(az-bw+c\sqrt{1-y^2-z^2-w^2}+dy)j+(aw+bz-cy+d\sqrt{1-y^2-z^2-w^2})k)\\
                &= \phi(q^{-1}p(\sqrt{1-y^2-z^2-w^2}+iy+jz+kw))\\
\end{align*}

The expression $q^{-1}p(\sqrt{1-y^2-z^2-w^2}+iy+jz+kw)$ is smooth where defined
and the projection $\phi$ is smooth. Therefore $\psi_q\psi_p^{-1}$ is smooth and
therefore the $\psi_q$s form a chart for $S^3\subset\bb{H}$.

\begin{problem}
  Let $X$ be a copy of the real line $\bb{R}$ and let $\phi:X\rightarrow\bb{R}$ be
  $\phi(x)=x^3$. Taking $\phi$ as a chart, this defines a smooth structure on
  $X$. Prove or disprove the following statements:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $X$ is diffeomorphic to $\bb{R}$;
  \item the identity map $X\rightarrow\bb{R}$ is a diffeomorphism;
  \item $\phi$ together with the identity map comprise an atlas;
  \item on the one-point compactification $X^+$ of $X$, $\phi,\psi$ give an
    atlas, where $\psi(x)=1/x$, for $x\neq 0,\infty,$ and $\psi(\infty)=0$. ($\psi$ is defined
    on $X^+\setminus\{0\}$.)
  \end{enumerate}
