\begin{problem}[1]
  For the map $\phi(x)=x\sin(x)$ of the real line to itself,
  what are the regular values?
\end{problem}

Since $\phi$ is a map from $\bb{R}$ to $\bb{R}$ we can acquire
the critical points via the usual method from calculus.
Thus the regular values the points that are not solutions to
\[
  \sin(x)+x\cos(x) =0
\]

\begin{problem}[2]
  For the map $\phi(x,y)=x^2-y^2$ of the plane to the line, what
  are the regular values?
\end{problem}

The pushforward for $\phi$ will be $\phi_*(x,y)=(2x,-2y)$. Since we are
mapping from 2 dimensions to 1 the regular values will
be those where $\phi_*$ is surjective. This will be the points
where neither $x$ nor $y$ are 0.

\begin{problem}[3]
  For the map $\phi(x,y)=\sin(x^2+y^2)$ of the plane to the line,
  what are the regular values?
\end{problem}

First rewrite the function as $\phi(r)=\sin(r^2)$. Then if
we take the derivative we get $\phi'(r)=2r\cos(r^2)$. Thus
the critical values are when $r=0$ or when $r=\pm\sqrt{\frac{(2k+1)\pi}{2}}$
for $k\in \bb{Z}$. Translating back to $x,y$ we have that the
regular values are when the equations $x^2+y^2=0$ and
$x^2+y^2=\frac{(2k+1)\pi}{2}$ for $k\in \bb{Z}$ do not hold.

\begin{problem}[5]
  Let $\gamma:\bb{R}\rightarrow\bb{R}^2$ be a smooth curve in the plane.
  Let $K$ be the set of all $r\in \bb{R}$ such that the circle of
  radius $r$ about the origin is tangent to the curve $\gamma$ at
  some point. Show that $K$ has empty interior in $\bb{R}$.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Define $\delta(t)=|\gamma(t)|$. Then the critical points of
  $\delta$ are precisely the points in $K$. By Sard's theorem
  the critical points of $\delta$ are of measure zero. Thus
  $K$ is of measure and cannot contain any intervals. It
  then follows that no point in $K$ has an open neighborhood
  around it and as such the interior of $K$ is empty.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}[6]
  If $C$ is a circle embedded smoothly in $\bb{R}^4$, show that
  there exists a three-dimensional hyperplane $H$ such that the
  orthogonal projection of $C$ to $H$ is an embedding.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $\gamma:C\rightarrow\bb{R}^4$ be a smooth embedding of $C$ into $\bb{R}^4$.
\end{proof}
